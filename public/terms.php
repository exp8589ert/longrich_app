4. The permissions you give us
We need certain permissions from you to provide our services:
Permission to use content that you create and share: Some content that you share or upload, such as photos or videos, may be protected by intellectual property laws.
You own the intellectual property rights (things such as copyright or trademarks) in any such content that you create and share on this platform (Longrichs.com). Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want.
<br />
<br />
However, to provide our services, we need you to give us some legal permissions (known as a ‘licence') to use this content. This is solely for the purposes of providing and improving Longrich's Products and services.

Specifically, when you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights on or in connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content. This means, for example, that if you share a photo on this website, you give us permission to store, copy and share it with others such as service providers that support our service or other Longrich Products you use. This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by informing us about deleting your account. 
<br />
<br />
When you delete content, it's no longer visible to other users; however, it may continue to exist elsewhere on our systems where: Immediate deletion is not possible due to technical limitations like:

your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case, this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or Where immediate deletion would restrict our ability to:
investigate or identify illegal activity or breaches of our Terms and Policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our Products or systems); comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
In each of the above cases, this licence will continue until the content has been fully deleted.
<br />
<br />
5. Permission to use your name (Family name and First name), profile picture, (With exception of your account details. Your account details will never be shared or disclosed for any reason except you grant us the permission or the government request for it for investigative purposes.) and information about your actions with ads and sponsored content: You give us permission to use your name and profile picture and information about actions that you have taken on this website next to or in connection with ads, offers and other sponsored content that we display across our Products, without any compensation to you.

<br />
<br />
Permission to update this website, any of our software that you use or download: If you download or use our software, you give us permission to download and install updates to the software where available.

<br />
<br />
Account suspension or termination
We want this platform (Longrichs.com) to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas about Longrich products and their benefits.

If we determine that you have clearly, seriously or repeatedly breached our Terms or Policies, including in particular our Community Standards, we may suspend or permanently disable access to your account. We may also suspend or disable your account if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so for legal reasons.
<br />
<br />
Where we take such action, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request a review, unless doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; or where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.
