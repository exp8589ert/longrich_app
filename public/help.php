	<button class="accordion">What is direct selling?</button>
		<div class="section">
		<p>
			Direct selling consists of two main business models: single-level marketing, in which a direct seller makes money by buying products from a parent organization and selling them directly to customers. 
			<br />
			<br />
			This Business model is a distant relative to multi-level marketing (also known as network marketing or person-to-person marketing) in which the direct seller may earn money from both direct sales to customers and by sponsoring new direct sellers and potentially earning a commission from their efforts.
